# LED-animation
This is an Arduino code that listens to input commands sent through serial communication to control the animation of an Adafruit NeoPixel LED strip accordingly. Make sure you have the NeoPixel library installed and the appropriate hardware setup (more information at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview).

This code is part of my Master's Thesis work entitled "Effective Non-Verbal Communication for Mobile Robots using Expressive Lights" by Kim Baraka available at http://ri.cmu.edu/publications/effective-non-verbal-communication-for-mobile-robots-using-expressive-lights/, used to communicate the internal states of an autonomous mobile service robot to humans at a distance.

The file of interest is in the folder Cobot_LED_improved, to be uploaded on an Arduino board and with which you can communicate using a serial command following the protocol described in Arduino_commands.txt
